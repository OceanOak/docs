# Get Started in 5 Minutes

To change these docs and test the results locally:

```sh
npm install
npm run-script start
```

## Project Structure

There are two important branches:

- main
- gh-pages

The website is hosted from `gh-pages`, but everything there is auto-generated
from `main`. When we want to make changes, we create a new branch off `main`
with the format `username/my-change` and make as many commits as we need to.
Then, we create a new pull request from that branch with `main` as the base.
When the pull request is merged, CircleCI will automatically deploy the changes
from `main` to the website (it runs a script against the source files on `main`
and deploys the generated website to `gh-pages`).

### Directory Structure

The project file structure in `main` is

```
docs/
  README.md -- this file
  .circleci/
    config.yml -- used to autodeploy via circle ci
  docs/ -- individual markdown documentation pages
    changelog.md
    getting-started.md
    assets/ -- images that can be referenced in the doc pages
    ...
  package.json -- helper scripts
  siteConfig.js -- core site configuration
  sidebars.json -- sidebar sections and pages
  blog/ -- we don't use this yet but might want to for the changelog. See [this](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/adding-blog).
  core/
    Footer.js -- a customizable footer for the website. Required by docusaurus
  pages/ -- additional docs pages not currently linked from anywhere
    en/
      help.js -- help page
      users.js -- users of this project page
  static/
    css/
    img/
  node_modules/
  .gitignore -- ignores autogenerated files that shouldn't sync via git
```

# Editing Content

## Editing an existing docs page

Edit docs by navigating to `docs/` and editing the corresponding document:

`docs/doc-to-be-edited.md`

```markdown
---
id: page-needs-edit
title: This Doc Needs To Be Edited
---

Edit me...
```

[here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation)

# Adding Content

## Adding a new docs page to an existing sidebar

1. Create the doc as a new markdown file in `/docs`, example
   `docs/newly-created-doc.md`:

```md
---
id: newly-created-doc
title: This Doc Needs To Be Edited
---

My new content here..
```

2. Refer to that doc's ID in an existing sidebar in `sidebar.json`:

```javascript
// Add newly-created-doc to the Getting Started category of docs
{
  "docs": {
    "Getting Started": [
      "quick-start",
      "newly-created-doc" // new doc here
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

[here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation)

## Adding items to your site's top navigation bar

1. Add links to docs, custom pages or external links by editing the headerLinks
   field of `siteConfig.js`:

`siteConfig.js`

```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    /* you can add docs */
    { doc: 'my-examples', label: 'Examples' },
    /* you can add custom pages */
    { page: 'help', label: 'Help' },
    /* you can add external links */
    { href: 'https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus', label: 'GitHub' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

[here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation)

## Adding custom pages

1. Docusaurus uses React components to build pages. The components are saved as
   .js files in `pages/en`:
2. If you want your page to show up in your navigation header, you will need to
   update `siteConfig.js` to add to the `headerLinks` element:

`siteConfig.js`

```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    { page: 'my-new-custom-page', label: 'My New Custom Page' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

[here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/custom-pages).

## Checking formatting

We run some tools to ensure that the docs are consistently formatted and to find
common errors. If you run `npm run format` you should pass the linter.

`markdownlint` is run automatically in CI - you can run it locally as
`npm run lint`.

# How CI Auto-deploys

The `.circleci/config.yml` file describes the CircleCI configuration. It watches
for commits/merges into the `main` branch, runs a script to generate the
contents of `gh-pages`, and pushes `gh-pages` to github.

# Publishing Changes Manually

**NOTE: You shouldn't need to do this because CircleCI runs this
automatically.**

On the commandline (remember to replace `<YOUR USERNAME>` with your github
username):

```sh
$ GIT_USER=<YOUR USERNAME> CURRENT_BRANCH=main npm deploy
```

If you're using ssh instead of https, replace `GIT_USER=<YOUR USERNAME>` with
`USE_SSH=true`.
