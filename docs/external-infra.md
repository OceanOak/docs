## Connect to Existing Infrastructure

If you already have an existing application, you can build a new service for it in Dark. To connect to any other external infrastructure, connect to it's REST API using Dark's [HTTPClient Library](/docs/httpclient).

Dark operates in US-West.

## Add Additional Functionality

While Dark is in private beta, not all functionality is available. If you need something that Dark does not support yet, you could also integrate to an external service via the [HTTPClient Library](/docs/httpclient).

## Sample Integrations
