### Support

We provide support via the
[Dark Community Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite). Dark engineers answer
questions, often within minutes. Lots of experienced community members are also
around to offer helpful suggestions.

Feel free to hit us up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/darklang) as well; we
usually answer this immediately.

You can also send us feedback or ask questions via
[email](mailto:feedback@darklang.com). We answer every email we are sent. This
is great for long-form feedback, which we really appreciate!
