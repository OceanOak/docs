### Support

We provide support via the
[Dark Community Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite). Dark engineers answer
questions, often within minutes. Lots of experienced community members are also
around to offer helpful suggestions.

It is usually helpful to include a link to the handler you're having an issue with, and possibly also link to a trace that shows the problems, for example:

- `https://darklang.com/a/paul#handler=1641560826&trace=c8183003-d74e-5f1d-bcd7-3be1ee5a1640`

If you click on a handler and a trace, you'll find this url in the browser's location
bar.


You can also send us feedback or ask questions via
[email](mailto:feedback@darklang.com). We answer every email we are sent. This
is great for long-form feedback, which we really appreciate!
