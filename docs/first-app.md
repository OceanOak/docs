We're going to take you through a tutorial to build an entire application that
uses Dark's basic functionality. This should take between 10m and 45m, depending
on how thorough you are.

If your account was created after March 2020, you can see a completed version of
this tutorial at _darklang.com/a/USERNAME-gettingstarted_. If you'd like to
start from scratch, navigate to a fresh canvas
(_darklang.com/a/USERNAME-gettingstarted2_, for example.)

A completed version of this tutorial, is also available at
[https://darklang.com/a/sample-gettingstarted](https://darklang.com/a/sample-gettingstarted).
Note that you should **not** copy/paste this &ndash; we want to teach you to use
the Dark editor.
