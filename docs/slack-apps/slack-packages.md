We've built in a variety of functions to make it easier to build Dark apps with Slack. Use these functions from autocomplete (dark/slack/Slack::), the same way you would any other function.

### `getNewConversations`

Takes your Slack token as a `String` and `checkFromSeconds` as an `Int`, and returns a list of conversations (as records) where the created at date is greater than the current time minus the `checkFromSeconds` time. Each entry contains the channel name, id, created at date (in Epoch seconds), creator, count of members, purpose and current topic.
