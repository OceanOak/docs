In order to install your app across multiple Slack workspaces, you will need to
set up OAuth. If you're not familiar with OAuth, the basic explanation is that
your app needs to go through a few steps to verify that it is allowed to access
a workspace. The three steps are:

1. Asking for scopes
2. Waiting for a user to approve your requested scopes
3. Exchanging a temporary authorization code for an access token

You may be familiar with this workflow without even knowing it - it's likely
what occurs anytime you see a screen this like when trying to install something:

In order to set up OAuth on your Slack app, you will need to take a few steps:

1. Go to your Slack app's **Manage Distribution** page and add an OAuth redirect
   URL:

This URL should be in the following format: The URL you provide will need to be
in the following format:
https://USERNAME-CANVASNAME.builtwithdark.com/oauth-redirect

2. Return to the main **Manage Distribution** page, copy the Sharable URL and
   then navigate to it. Follow the steps, making sure to finish with clicking
   Allow.

3. Go to your Dark canvas and look in your 404s list to find your
   `oauth-redirect` handler, complete with trace. Click the `+` to add it to
   your canvas.

4. Create a new Datastore called `tokenStore`, and add two `String` fields:
   `team_id` and `access_token`.

5. Return to your `oauth-redirect` handler and call the
   [`Slack::oauth` function](./slack-packages#oauth). You will need your client
   ID and client secret, as well as the token store you created in the previous
   step. The final parameter is pulling the temporary code out of the request
   using `request.queryParams.code`.

6. Hit the play button for the function. If you get an error, repeat step 2. If
   everything goes as expected, an entry will be added to your datastore, and it
   will look locked.
