Connecting your Trello account with your Slack account can make for a powerful
tool - no more switching tabs and hunting for the right Trello list when you
want to capture the excellent idea that just came up. In this tutorial, we'll
show you a few ways to enable your team to create new Trello cards directly from
Slack.

A [sample canvas](https://darklang.com/a/sample-createnewtrellocard) for this
tutorial is available.

## Trello Configuration

For this tutorial, you're going to need to grab a few different things from
Trello and store each of them as separate functions in Dark:

-Your Trello API Key and Token,
[available on this page](https://trello.com/app-key/) -Your Trello org id, the
id for one of your boards, and the id for one of your lists. The best way to get
all of these at once is to add `.json` to the end of the URL on one of your
boards, and search through the resulting JSON for the `id` that matches with the
name of your board, the `id` that matches with the name of the list you'd like
to use and `idOrganization`. Don't worry - we'll cover an easier way to handle
this later in the tutorial.

## Slack Configuration

1. [Create a new app in Slack](https://api.slack.com/apps).
2. Set a Slash command (the option should appear under **Add features &
   functionality** on your app's main page.)

![slack-apps/tutorials/new-trello-card/slashcommand.png](/docs/img/slack-apps/tutorials/new-trello-card/slashcommand.png)

3. Add the following scopes to your app.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.43.45_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.43.45_PM.png)

3. Install your app to the workspace (either via **Settings -> Basic
   Information** or **Settings -> Install App**). Since this app is being built
   for your workspace specifically, we will not need to set up full OAuth, like
   we would if we wanted to distribute this more publicly.

4. Copy your bot user access token, which will now be available under **Settings
   -> Install** app and save it as a function in your Dark canvas. Use this
   function wherever you see `token` in the code examples.

5. Attempt to use your slash command - you will see an error.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.52.08_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.52.08_PM.png)

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.45.14_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.45.14_PM.png)

6. Navigate to your Dark canvas and check the 404s box - you should see an HTTP
   POST created. Click the plus sign to add it to your canvas.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.45.29_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.45.29_PM.png)

7. Once it's on your canvas, you can place your carat over the trace on the left
   (the white dot) to see the incoming data Slack attempted to send.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.48.50_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.48.50_PM.png)

8. In the body of your trace data, you will see a text field in the body. This
   is what we want to parse to get the name and description of the card we're
   going to create. In order to parse this information, we're going to use
   `String::split` and parse on the special character `|`.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.53.21_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.53.21_PM.png)

9. Now that we have a list of `messageContent`, we can use `List::getAt` to set
   the name and description of the card.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.54.04_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.54.04_PM.png)

10. Once we have all of the information we need, we can use the Dark package
    manager `Trello::createNewCard` function to create the new card. For
    simplicity's sake, we're going to use the `defaultListID` we set earlier.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.54.46_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.54.46_PM.png)

11. Re-run your HTTP handler, or call the slash command again and then check
    Trello - your new card will be there!

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.54.58_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_1.54.58_PM.png)

12. Now, you probably don't want to have to worry about setting up a default
    list or hunting for the list ids in JSON. Create a Lists db.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.05.32_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.05.32_PM.png)

13. Now, we can use built in Dark package manager functions to get a list of all
    of our Trello lists and add them to our DB.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.07.17_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.07.17_PM.png)

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.07.33_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.07.33_PM.png)

14. Let's try another slash command, this time with more information.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.09.04_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.09.04_PM.png)

15. Now our `messageContent` will have a third entry in the list.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.09.50_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.09.50_PM.png)

16. Now, using the built in `Trello:lookUpListID` function, we can grab the name
    of that list and use it in our `createNewCard` function.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_1.34.24_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_1.34.24_PM.png)

17. Okay, this is all great, but still has some problems. What if someone
    forgets to add the right special character? Let's make it a little easier,
    by creating a modal to take their information.

First, let's create a new slash command:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.59.02_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.59.02_PM.png)

You're also going to want to turn Interactivity on and specify a URL for the
interaction to be sent to:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.03.32_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.03.32_PM.png)

18. Now, just like before, we're going to call the Slash command and grab
    the 404.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.59.38_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_2.59.38_PM.png)

19. First, grab your `trigger_id` from the `request.body`:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.01.13_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.01.13_PM.png)

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.01.31_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.01.31_PM.png)

20. Next, create an `HttpClient::post` request and add your `trigger_id` and
    JSON. These are truncated screenshots with a lot of the JSON cut out:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.01.41_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.01.41_PM.png)

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.02.04_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-07_at_3.02.04_PM.png)

21. Now, try your Slash command - a modal should open. Input text and try to
    send. You will get an error message:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.06.48_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.06.48_PM.png)

22. Now we need to work with our `/interaction` handler, which should be
    available in your 404s. We're going to start with parsing the payload Slack
    sent through:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.09.56_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.09.56_PM.png)

23. Now we can use that payload to grab the information that you submitted in
    your modal:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.17.50_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.17.50_PM.png)

24. And, just like before, we'll use the `Trello::lookUpListID` to take the
    list:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.17.57_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.17.57_PM.png)

25. And now all that's left is creating the new card and sending a 200 response
    back to Slack:

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.18.11_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.18.11_PM.png)

26. Try to create another ticket.

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.18.30_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.18.30_PM.png)

27. Once you hit submit, your ticket will appear in Trello!

![New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.18.45_PM.png](New%20Trello%20Card/Screen_Shot_2020-04-08_at_12.18.45_PM.png)

Congratulations, you now have a Slack app that can create Trello cards in
multiple ways!
