### Support

We provide support via the
[Dark Community Slack](https://darklang.com/slack-invite). Dark engineers answer
questions, often within minutes. Lots of experienced community members are also
around to offer helpful suggestions.

You can also send us feedback or ask questions via
[email](mailto:feedback@darklang.com). We answer every email we are sent.
