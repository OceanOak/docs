Dark is a language and framework for building web backends: REST API endpoints,
asynchronous background workers, scheduled jobs, and persistent storage. Dark's
framework is tightly coupled to the infrastructure, and as you write code you're
able to develop from real incoming requests/traces.

## Hello World

![Hello World](/img/helloworld.gif)

Above, you can see the simplest app in Dark: the hello world app. It shows
starting with an empty canvas, creating a HTTP endpoint (`GET /hello`), running
code (`"Hello world"`) and opening that page.

## Guide to documentation

The documentation is split into
- [tutorials](./tutorials)
- [how-to guides](./how-to)
- [background, discussions and explanations](./discussion)
- [reference materials](./reference)

New folks should start at [Your First App](./your-first) to build their first app on Dark.
