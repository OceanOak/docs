title: Hello World!
---

Dark is a language and framework for building web backends: REST API endpoints,
asynchronous background workers, scheduled jobs, and persistent storage. Dark's
framework is tightly coupled to the infrastructure, and as you write code you're
able to develop from real incoming requests/traces.

_Note: for now, Dark is only supported for Chrome with browser extensions
disabled, or using our [Desktop Client](desktop-client)._

## Hello World

Above, you can see the simplest app in Dark: the hello world app. It shows
starting with an empty canvas, creating a HTTP endpoint (`GET /hello`), running
code (`"Hello world"`) and opening that page.
