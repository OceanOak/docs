title: If you don't know OCaml
---

OCaml can be a little bit daunting, but even if you don't know it, there are a bunch of ways to get involved.

## Other languages

Dark has a number of different languages, including Rust, bash, Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

We have issues in each of these:
- [Javascript](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ajavascript)
- [Rust](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Arust)
- [Bash](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abash)

## Non-code

Lots of times we don't know what to do, and it's extremely valuable to have
someone look into the problem and document what's happening. These issues are
labeled ["investigation"](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ainvestigation).

Similar, the "[needs thought](https://github.com/darklang/dark/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aneeds-thought)" issue is about designing thoughtful solutions to sticky problems.

## Writing docs

There are lots of docs that would be very helpful to write. If you look at the
[current docs](https://docs.darklang.com), there are docs that would be useful
that you can write as a non-expert.

There are a bunch of
[tutorials](https://darklang.github.io/docs/tutorials/tutorial-intro) for
different technologies, frameworks and libraries; writing one for another would
be extremely useful. It would also allow you to write up how Dark could be
improved to support that technology.

Similarly, we have some guides for people learning Dark who know other
languages. Adding another language would be wonderful. See for example the
[Python version](https://darklang.github.io/docs/from-python).

## Writing issues

Dark has many bugs and problems: documenting them for other contributors to fix
would be very useful. Small, compact descriptions with instructions to
reproduce the bugs are very welcome.

### Fluid editor

The "fluid" editor is how you write code in Dark. It is still often the case
that you get an unexpected result when you type something: documenting
individual cases as issues is very valuable!

### Better error messages

Dark's error messages are not as good as they could be, and this is a real
problem for users learning the language the first time. Documenting a bad error
message, especially with a suggested better version, is a really useful
contribution.
