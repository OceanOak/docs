_Note that you can also
[contribute without writing OCaml code](if-you-dont-know-ocaml.md)!_

This guide will get you making your first PR to the Dark repo. It helps you set
up the repo, write your first test, and make your first pull request. After
that, it will guide you on how to work on bigger things, especially the current
big project to [port the backend to F#](porting-the-dark-backend.md).

If you'd like help contributing, you can
[book a pairing session with Paul Biggar to help](https://calendly.com/paul-biggar/dark-contributor-pairing-session).

Before you do that, it's helpful to:

- Join the
  [#development channel](https://darkcommunity.slack.com/archives/C014H6H6BB3)
  in the Dark Slack (join using
  [this invite](https://darklang.com/slack-invite)).
- Sign the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/darklang/cla)
