title: Setting up the Dark repo
---

You can access the Dark repo at https://github.com/darklang/dark. This is is a
monorepo containing the main OCaml backend, the editor (client in
Bucklescript), as well as some auxiliary services (Rust mostly) used to run the
Dark infrastructure.

- Run through the installation instructions in the [README](https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/README.md)
- You should now be running `./scripts/builder --compile --test --watch` and seeing a completed build.
